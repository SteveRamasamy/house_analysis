# Property Market Analysis.
The property market in Perth, Western Australia, like any other, is influenced by a multitude of factors, each exerting varying degrees of impact. This creates a complex tapestry within the real estate landscape. In this study, I have endeavored to dissect the influence of specific variables such as the number of rooms, property age, and land size, all intricately intertwined with the proximity to key locations like the CBD, coastal regions, and the Swan River on property prices.

Through rigorous statistical and analytical analysis of property data encompassing features like land area, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms, it becomes evident that these property characteristics hold a significant correlation with property values. Notably, property values exhibited a noteworthy increase of approximately 37% and 40% , when the number of bedrooms increased from 4 to 5 and 8 to 9, respectively. This observation finds validation through various statistical methods, including Ordinary Least Square, Student's T test, and Linear Regression analyses.

Interestingly, school rankings exert a substantial 45% influence (Slide 6) on property prices, dwarfing the 10% sway attributed to the proximity of train stations near the Central Business District (CBD). Geographical distinctions also play a pivotal role, with properties located to the north of the river consistently commanding higher prices compared to their southern and eastern counterparts in Perth.

A historical perspective reveals that during the World War II period (1940-1945), a shortage of properties available for sale was observed (Slide 5 of the presentation). This scarcity likely stemmed from the redirection of resources towards the war effort, resulting in a noticeable gap in the housing market. Statistical analyses have underscored a strong relationship between the proximity of water bodies, such as rivers and beaches, as well as the financial capacity of households and property prices.

However, it's crucial to acknowledge that this analysis does not encompass certain critical factors, including security, building type, proximity to recreational facilities, and population concentration. Additionally, anomalies such as properties with incorrect property features or labels were detected during the data cleaning and analysis process. Household income profiles were accurate as of 2021 and aggregated for Local Government Areas, leading to the grouping of all properties within those areas for analysis. Furthermore, when evaluating the impact of the distance to water bodies on property prices, only a subset of property locations was considered.

These unaccounted elements may exert a more substantial influence on housing prices. Consequently, future studies should explore these aspects in greater detail to provide a more holistic understanding of the dynamics that shape housing prices in Perth.
